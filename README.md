# Laravel-Blog
Blog made using Laravel, MySQL and Bluma. 

First thing was set up local environment, which I did not have success using Valet, as recommended in Laravel documentation.
Although, I got a piece of advice from Docker community to use docker compose and I could successfully set the local environment up.
Then, I could finally get to actually learn Laravel and follow as planned with the Sprints, as described bellow.

## Sprints

### First one: CRUD

### Second one: Users

### Third one: Search
